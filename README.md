#Quality Assurance Testing â€“ E-Learning Platform

I planned, wrote, and executed test cases for an e-learning platform, focusing on functional testing, reliability, and user experience.

In the MUX video upload module, I tested upload, processing, and playback functions across various devices and browsers. Test scenarios included unsupported formats, failed uploads, and buffering issues to ensure smooth video delivery.

For the Payment Gateway, I verified workflows such as card input validation, successful and failed transactions, refunds, and error handling. Security and transaction accuracy were key focus areas.

In the User Registration & Authentication module, I tested email validation, password policies, login/logout, and access control. I covered both valid and invalid scenarios, including duplicate entries and session handling.

The Course Management module included testing course creation, editing, publishing, and student enrollment. I also validated access permissions, course categorization, and progress tracking.

All test cases were documented in structured spreadsheets. I reported bugs with clear reproduction steps and worked with developers for debugging and verification.

This project enhanced my skills in test planning, execution, and issue tracking, giving me practical experience in the QA lifecycle and preparing me for professional QA roles.
